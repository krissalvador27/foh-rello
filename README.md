# Foh-rello

A lightweight application that's similar to trello but not (it's a work in progress). Utilizes local storage DB, although you'll need to comment code out in the `routes/lists.js` that currently clears your DB after refresh.

## TODO

- [ ] Drag and drop cards
- [ ] Ability to edit color
- [ ] Currently uses local storage DB so perhaps an API layer w/ saved user state
- [ ] Become a better trello (tentative)
- [ ] IPO (also tentative)
